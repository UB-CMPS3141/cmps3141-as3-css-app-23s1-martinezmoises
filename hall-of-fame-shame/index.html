    <h1>Hall of fame or shame?</h1>
    <img src="Saftey.png" alt="Screenshot" width="500px" height="300px">
   <center> <p>Link for the website used is: <a href="http://www.irishwrecksonline.net">http://www.irishwrecksonline.net</a> </p></center>
    <br>
    <p>I like..</p>
    <li>That the they have a search function.</li>
    <li>That the they provide email to send erros, omissions, inclusions.</li>

    <p>I wish..</p>
    <ul>
      <li>That the colors matched a little more.</li>
      <li>That the website had better looking images.</li>
      <li>That the colors were a little more dim.</li>
      <li>That once you click the name of the area it redirects you to it instead of clicking the point in the map.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What if...</p>
    <li>Instead of using cartoon images they used better quality images.</li>
    <li>More context of the website is included.</li>
    <li>A hover effect is added to the name of each area to indicate that they are clickable.</li>
